# 组件生成

When I use composer to generate files, try to follow my coding conventions when generating code, especially when generating components. The format should be: folder names in uppercase, containing a component with uppercase naming and an entry file index.ts. The index file should have a default export of the component.

For example, the structure would be like:

Button/
  ├── Button.tsx
  └── index.ts


Where Button.tsx would contain:
```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const Button: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      content
    </div>
  )
}

export default Button

```

Where index.ts would contain:

```ts
import Button from './Button'

export default Button
```

create it for me in the specified position
